## 👾 Concepts

**File structure** adheres to the concept of 
[atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

Using **redux** technology *isn't practical*, due to the limited scope of the project.

Two hooks are created to speed up the development process: 
1. **useInputValue** - to work with input properties;
2. **useItemPosition** - to work with item position via **ref**.

## 👨‍💻 Technology stack
1. **axios** with axios mock adapter to mock requests;
2. **momentjs** to working with dates;
3. **prop-types** to validation props;
4. **webfontloader** to load Roboto font;
5. **styled-components** to style components;
6. **eslint** to code style.
